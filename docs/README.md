## The 3 Types of Tasks

Soon Tong can help you keep track of 3 different kinds of tasks.

### 1. ToDo
Just plain, simple tasks - where the name is just enough.

Example: `todo go for class`

### 2. Deadline
Painful tasks you need to complete before a certain date.

Example: `deadline tutorial sheet /by 2025-09-15`

For the events with start and end dates.

Example: `event aunt's funeral /from 2025-02-15 /to 2025-02-16`
